<h1>
  Lifa - A library for finite automata
</h1>

Currently under construction.

```
What to expect?
  - Simple classes for the representation of finite automata (NFAs).
  - Basic algorithms around NFAs.
  - A graphical output for NFAs.
```

So if you want an intuitive implementation of an automata library without much squiggle, we recommend Lifa (:
